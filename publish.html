                Traveling Solo Royal Art Exhibition titled:BeninIconography.com
                to Benin City, her ancestral home. Princess (Mrs) Theresa
                Oghogho Iyase - Odozi has made invaluable contributions to the
                Promotion of Benin Culture through the various activities of her
                Green House Art Empowerment Centre, her vigorous research into
                Benin Art History and the robust application of her versatile
                creative talents to produce Mixed Media Documentation of several
                Benin Visual Art Icons. In deed, in the art scene she has
                established herself as a true daughter of Benin and a veritable
                Ambassador of Benin Culture.<br />reawakening and resurgence in
                response to the clarion call by His Royal Majesty, Omo N' Oba N'
                Edo, Uku Akpolokpolo, Ewuare II, Oba of Benin is auspicious. In
                fact the Artist states that part of her motivation for bringing
                BeninIconography.com to Benin City, is to honor the revered
                Monarch in commemoration of his birthday and the 3rd anniversary
                of his coronation.<br />Benin Kingdom” as unique as it is
                profound. Unique because I am not aware of any other Artist that
                has explored the meaning of Cross with equal arms in a circle
                which appears in some ancient Benin Artworks. Princess Oghogho
                links the origin of this symbol to the time the Portuguese
                brought Christianity to Benin during the reign of Oba Esigie. It
                remains to be seen whether this symbol was known to the Benins
                before their contact with the Europeans, and what the symbol
                really means.<br />of 'Self ' and the related 'Destiny'.
                Uhunmwun applies to the visible self and Ehi to the invisible
                self. In the common parlance Ehi comes before Uhunmwun so that
                we have “Ehimwen vbe Uhunmmwen” which implies that spirit takes
                precedence over the physical body. It will be of interest to
                know why the artist seems to have reversed the order in the
                current presentation. As the Artist shares with the audience her
                appreciation of the Symbolism and imagery displayed in the works
                displayed in this exhibition she is bound to unlock several
                barriers and make history.<br />Finally, Princess (Mrs) Oghogho
                Iyase deserves to be highly commended for her eﬀort to revive
                Batik traditions in Benin Culture.

                Princess Iyase-Odozi's research into the historic methods and
                materials of Edo batikmaking provides the viewer ﬁrst-hand
                contact with this unique textile popularly adorned by the Edo
                people just a few decades ago. Viewed in a collection, these
                fabrics give an insight into how members of a royal household in
                the Benin kingdom adorned themselves. Although the dye colours
                mostly used were earthy browns, she has extended this a notch
                further by rendering the batik in predominantly reds and
                magenta. It is well known that the sources for dye in ancient
                Benin was from tree barks, Kola nuts and oxide-coloured soft
                stone which the people processed by grinding, pounding and
                fermenting. Some women also used these dyes in a mixture with
                clay to polish earthen ﬂoors and walls. It was the source of
                pigment before the arrival of the Europeans. According to Chief
                Okundaye (husband to Chief Mrs Nike Okundaye ),dye pigments were
                sourced from those 3 materials before the Europeans came. I
                interviewed him since he has a ﬁrst- hand experience (from his
                mother who was into this cra). As a young boy he watched as his
                own mother processed them by pounding, grinding and fermenting
                (his mother was a known practitioner of this craft in Benin).
                With the advent of new imported dyes the local practitioners
                quickly abandoned the hard-to-process indigenous dyes for the
                quick –to-use foreign dyes. Along with the introduction of
                foreign dyes came a wider range of colours. This action of
                theirs gradually led to the dearth of this unique fabric. With
                this new initiative, Edo batik is set to make a comeback.
                Princess IyaseOdozi has succeeded in restoring back to the
                people of Benin – and, by extension, Nigeria - a lost heritage,
                another indigenous textile they can be proud to export. On these
                fabrics, one ﬁnds a plethora of motifs, some used as raw images,
                others more stylised, including crosses indicative of early
                contact with Christian missionaries.

                  When there is any gathering anywhere in the universe to
                  discuss the Benin kingdom, it is mandatory to recognize the
                  presence, sacredness and authority of his Royal Majesty, Oba
                  Ewuare II the Oba of The Benin ancient kingdom was a peaceful
                  settlement situated in the midwest region of western Nigeria.
                  The kingdom spanned across the borders of river Niger in the
                  East, Idah in the North, with Lagos as a colony on the
                  Atlantic coast of southwest and the mangrove forests of
                  South-South at the coastal banks of Atlantic oceans. The
                  administration of Benin kingdom was such a peacefully
                  structured system of professional guilds in quarters-
                  Idumuewena, Igbesanmwan, Ivbiebo, (Guild of bronze caster,
                  Builders, Fashion Designers, Farmers etc) The communal Edo
                  Cultural traditions and way of life astonished the European
                  visitors on ﬁrst arrival to Benin. The organizational and
                  administrative structure of the kingdom was a discomfort to
                  the western invaders. The Holy Aruosa was replaced with
                  Christianity. However, the replacement of Aruosa with
                  Christianity did not lead to transformation. Nothing has come
                  out of it so far, than a people divided on what Osanobua god
                  is. The more spiritual experiences people have, the more
                  religious arguments and diversities. Benin Iconography is the
                  way people of Benin Kingdom present ideas in pictures, images,
                  religion, politics, language, food, music, dance and general
                  living. Ferdinard De Saussure a Swiss father of semantics has
                  the following to say:<br />
                  <i
                    >“Semiotics is about how sign produce meaning through
                    analysis. Such analysis is a social fuction not
                    individual”</i
                  ><br />
                  It's a shared norm-agreed on, in a particular communal
                  setting. For example, that is why popular culture drives
                  semiotics. This is domiciled in visual literacy – visual
                  communication of signs and symbols understood by all within a
                  particular

                  - Dr John Ajewole
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                  The preview of the Benin Iconography Exhibition took oﬀ on a
                  very positive note at the Thought Pyramid Art Centre, Ikoyi.
                  The joint-event consisted of a Press Preview and an Art
                  Discourse and was well attended by some prominent Nigerian and
                  foreign Art Stakeholders. Princess Iyase-Odozi, a renowned
                  Nigerian female visual artist and a product of University of
                  Lagos where I lecture, made a power-point presentation to
                  provide the background to the Exhibition and highlight the
                  processes entailed in producing the works to be exhibited.
                  What she is oﬀering with such passion is a new and unique
                  vista of Benin contemporary modernist art practice which she
                  seeks to deploy in celebrating the laudable eﬀorts of Oba
                  Ewuare II of Benin to revitalise the culture. Iyase-Odozi's
                  professional reputation as a contemporary visual artist
                  precedes her through her works and she has now challenged Art
                  historians by her visual narrative on some dimensions of Benin
                  Art, particularly its iconography. Thus, during the recent
                  Press Preview event, I stressed the urgent need for proper
                  documentation of our Arts and Culture, which Iyase-Odozi is
                  doing in her own way by appropriating the icons she found on
                  ancient Benin artefacts for her mixed-media paintings.
                  Iyase-Odozi attaches great signiﬁcance and meaning to these
                  icons, particularly the Circled Cross, the latter of which she
                  asserts is the symbol of Divine Truth. Thus, Iyase-Odozi's
                  latest creative exploration transcends the physical to embrace
                  deeper concepts and paradigms. This is, indeed, a signiﬁcant
                  and historic initiative that deserves commendation and support
                  by art stakeholders, particularly the Benin royalty, the State
                  Government and promoters.

                Benin Art: An Invaluable Resource for Artists in a Time of
                Cultural Iconoclasm <br />
                - Mr Tobenna Okwuosa
              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                It is becoming increasingly diﬃcult to discuss the relevance of
                traditional art and culture in a contemporary world that
                privileges the ideologies and ways of the Global North over
                those of the Global South. In global contemporary art practice,
                we have also moved beyond the period where Otherness and
                indigenous cultural elements were the deﬁning qualities of
                authenticity for modern and contemporary African artists.
                However, in this neoliberal, postmodern period, there are
                artists who still explore traditional African artistic practices
                with great passion; giving them renewed relevance in a time that
                is characterized by crude iconoclasm. Princess Theresa Iyase
                Odozi is one of such artists, and she uses this exhibition to
                redirect our attention to Benin art: its extensive icons and
                relevance.<br />Benin art, particularly those made in bronze,
                ivory and wood, are rich in icons, symbols and motifs. Benin art
                was the ﬁrst traditional art, in what is today known as Nigeria,
                to receive international acclaim shortly after the 1897 British
                Punitive Expedition when objects looted by the British soldiers
                began circulating in the West. Some Western modernist artists
                such as Emil Nolde and Max Pechstein were inspired by the arts
                of Benin. Ben Enwonwu, the foremost modern Nigerian artist,
                explored ideas in Benin art and tradition. According to
                Sylvester Ogbechie, Edo culture gave Enwonwu “a stock of images
                and a cultural identity that he embraced wholeheartedly ... His
                art showed the inﬂuences of themes and images adopted from this
                culture until his death.” Benin art and culture have also
                inspired the works of Bruce Onobrakpeya. From
                1978–1984,“Onobrakpeya made series of pictures called Benin
                vignettes which enact Benin historical symbols.” In the recent
                times, Peju Layiwola has carried out major art projects that
                investigated the British Punitive Expedition of 1897 and its
                lingering consequences. Her seminal art exhibition,
                <i>Benin1897. com: Art and the Restitution Question</i>, was
                held in 2010. Although some modern and contemporary artists have
                drawn inspirations from Benin art, it is yet to be explored in
                the scale and scope that some traditional art forms such as Uli
                (Igbo) and Ona (Yoruba) have been explored. <br /><b

                is an ambitious project by which Princess Theresa Iyase-Odozi
                seeks to show the rich iconic content of Benin art. She
                challenges us to research into the meanings and signiﬁcance of
                Benin cultural objects, and shows Benin art as a rich resource
                for creatives in a time of cultural atrophy. Princess Theresa
                Iyase-Odozi is an artist, cultural activist, and an entrepreneur
                with a growing proﬁle in the Nigerian art world.

                I have always known Princess Theresa Iyase-Odozi to be
                audacious. Not only is it daring to live in the Ogun State
                Suburb, where she resides, she constantly empowers scores of men
                and women through her art and GreenHouse Art Empowerment Centre
                in Olambe.<br />Her attempt at rekindling history through her
                Travelling Historical Solo Royal Art Exhibition, entitled:
                <i
                  >Uhunmwun Vbe Ehinmwen and the Master of the Circled Cross in
                  Benin Kingdom</i
                >has yet again laid credence to her bravery.<br />While blending
                diverse art forms/media with fashion, her exhibition seeks to
                bring to the world stage Benin Iconographies and bring the world
                to Benin. It would also positively impact on Benin traditional
                textile industry, as well as the art and tourism sectors in Edo
                State.<br />When she ﬁrst voiced the idea of the exhibition and
                her desire to have me on her project team almost three years
                ago, it left me with excitement. It was the making of history
                and it was an honour to heed the call.<br />From the crafting to
                itemising and ﬁne-tuning of the idea, as well as pumping time
                and resources into the project with so much passion and energy,
                I watched her brace diverse challenges with undaunted
                determination. Indeed, on the road to the making of history only
                the brave remain standing when it's all said and done. Your
                courage is noteworthy, just as your attempt, brave. <br />I am
                proud to be associated with this woman of great talent who
                discovered the art in me. You are my inspiration and I celebrate
                you, your courage and accomplishments.<br />It is hoped that
                without waiting until the West comes to celebrate her ﬁrst, the
                government, especially of Edo State; the Ministry of Information
                and Culture; National Council of Arts and Culture (NCAC) and
                corporate bodies would see the immense potential in and support
                this great talent and her epoch-making art exhibition.

                Art as a Presence of the Creator on Earth<br />

              <p class="card-text">
                How wonderfully does the art imprinted on these batiks reinforce
                the fact that art is indeed the representation of the
                correspondence of virtue between a creature and the Creator. Art
                is what the human creature does when via its work it bears on
                earth an eternally moving fact of a life of the Creator. This
                motion or moving fact of a life of the Creator I ﬁrst
                experienced on earth at age thirteen the ﬁrst time I read
                Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice". Read below words, which
                Shakespeare spoke through Portia, asking Shylock (the Merchant
                of Venice) to render mercy unto Antonio.<br />“The quality of
                Mercy is not strained. It droppeth as the gentle rain from
                heaven upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:<br />It
                blesseth him that gives and him that takes. 'tis mightiest in
                the mightiest; it becomes the throned monarch better than his
                crown. His Sceptre shows the force of temporal power, the
                attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear
                of Kings; but Mercy is above this sceptred sway. It is enthroned
                in the hearts of Kings; it is an attribute to God Himself; and
                earthly power doth then show likest God's when Mercy seasons
                Justice".<br />Shakespeare's art is the very evidence of his
                correspondence of virtue with the Creator, whose correspondence
                is impossible without a correspondence medium in the earthly
                human body. The very essence of the body's correspondence medium
                is what Princess Iyase has imprinted on these batiks. Therefore,
                I dare say that these bartiks bear evidence of a time when art
                was how the ancient Africans worshipped the Creator. No, the
                ancient Africans did not see the Creator as the Whiteman in the
                sky people prayed to cowardly or begged for something. What a
                renaissance to see art being unveiled as the very religion,
                which once upon a time bound Africans to the Creator. May
                artists such as Princess Iyase increase in number and intensity
                and may we always harken to support their work of the grand
                renaissance.

                Ovia Cult in Benin Religion/Belief<br />
                -by Onigho, O.J.
              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                A ccording to T. Cullen Young, "No approach to any appreciation
                of indigenous ideas regarding God can take any path but that
                through the thoughtarea occupied by the ancestors”<br />Ovia
                cult worship evolved out of one of the Benin ancestors of the
                distant past. Ovia, t hough previ ousl y human but dead, i s
                believed to have survived death and is living in the spiritual
                realm from where it watches over the life of the faithful and
                upright worshippers.<br />Ovia cult has its myth known to its
                devotees/worshippers. This, they learn in the 'ogua' (groove).
                J.S. Mbiti, in his book "African Religions and Philosophy,
                asserts that " To African people,.....religious universe is not
                an academic proposition. It is an empirical experience which
                reaches its height in acts of worship." The 'ogua' is a symbolic
                representation of 'Erinmwin' (spiritual or Sacred world or
                heaven) with all its supposed concomitant impeccable features as
                against the 'Agbon' (the village or community or earth) with all
                its worldly absurdities and sins. So, when devotees go into
                seclusion to worship in the 'ogua', they are said to have gone
                to 'Erinmwin' where they are expected to learn or acquire or
                drink a good measure of the energies of the 'faultless' deity;
                which will help to enrich their character and guide their
                interpersonal relationship with others which promotes corporate
                existence. These 'ogua' returnees can now be described as 'new
                creatures' in transformation and sanctiﬁcation in holiness.
                <br />Ovia cult is fundamental to the life of the community. Its
                tenets/principle are very instructive and proﬁtable for
                doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
                righteousness. 2Timothy Chapter 3 verse 16b. Its emphasis on
                group solidarity has been a great ﬁllip to traditional corporate
                existence which enhances the community's values, aspiration and
                the maintenance of the local identity. Much of the sanctions
                that manifest harmony and orderliness in the community derive
                from its tenets.<br />
                Morality, according to E.B. Idowu, is basically the fruit of
                religion and ..... it is dependent upon it. Ovia, in the past,
                was absolutely believed to have full responsibility of life.
                Thus, the people implicitly obeyed/yielded to its tenets. And
                the moral tone of the community was quite high. Ovia cult
                teaches the 'God's own laws' as contained in Exodus Chapter 20
                verses 13 to 17.<br />
                Ovia cultural values permit the preservation and propagation of
                the attributes of the scriptural fruit of the spirit:love,joy,
                peace,long suﬀering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
                temperance ...... Galatians Chapter 5 verses 22 and 23. Devotees
                are educated/instructed in the cult for the beneﬁt of the larger
                community/society as the individual member strive to adjust to
                the standard of his community.

                Synoptic Analysis of Princess Iyase Odozi's Artworks<br />
                -Mr. Kunle Filani
              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                The exhibition titled The Renaissance of the Images and
                Symbolism of Benin Iconography is a watershed of some sort for
                Princess Iyase Odozi. It is signiﬁcant not only for the richness
                of the formal coordinates of the employed elements and
                principles of design, but mainly for adopting cultural
                aesthetics as the research framework for artistic creativity.
                <br />In a conscious and consistent move, Princess Iyase Odozi
                interrogates the semiotics of the ancient Benin empire using the
                regal personages as major references. She reconstructs and
                reinvents the dynamics of power of expression and the expression
                of power inherent in the well organized and articulate Benin
                kingdom, both in the ancient past and in the continuing
                indigenous present. A robust ventilation of the Benin /Edo
                royalty and royal personages recalls associated images and
                imageries of authority, prestige, dignity, respect, and
                religion. It certainly also brings back to life the echoes of
                creativity found in the court art of Benin. <br />The
                iconographic contents of her artworks depict the thoroughness of
                her research into the identiﬁcation of natural images and the
                conventional imageries associated with forms and motifs of
                royalty and traditional institutions. She therefore locates and
                identiﬁes the symbolic signiﬁcance of seemingly ordinary forms,
                images and patterns in relation to the larger cultural context.
                She also explores conventional image identity and pontiﬁcates on
                the coded interpretations. <br />Having fulﬁlled the
                iconographic principles espoused by Erwin Panofsky, she goes
                further to generate and regenerate new forms, signs and symbols
                that bear compliance to the established conventions of the
                ancient traditions. <br />Princess Iyase Odozi engages in
                indigenous methodologies and techniques of production such as
                the art of batik making and mixed- media painting. She derives
                her her forms and symbols from royal appurtenances, altars,
                totems, court and ceremonial images and commemorative plaques
                among other things. She engages in the training and retraining
                of art students and aspiring artists through the workshop system
                and apprenticeship where necessary. For her, this entrenches
                continuity in the education and training of interested students
                and artists. It also allows for continuity and the survival of
                skills acquisition and the Benin design consciousness in arts
                and culture. <br />Her aesthetic preference is no doubt royal
                and cultural. She adds fresh perspectives to the use of material
                and techniques and also contextualize her subject matter to the
                contemporary situations. This dynamic introduction of modern
                worldview does not allow for fossilized traditions. She avoids
                ossiﬁcation of traditional culture by articulating design
                sensibilities even when rooted in indigenous context. She no
                doubt has proved that she is a worthy princess of the Benin
                kingdom whose research activities not only cover artistic
                creativity but also delves into the realm of historical
                reconstruction.

                Prof. Dele Jegede
              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                Theresa Iyase-Odozi's latest project is a massive smorgasbord of
                well-conceived art events. She is oﬀering a quintuple exhibition
                that attempts to essentialize the artist as scholar-entrepreneur
                convoker. First, the project summons scholars to essay on
                critical aspects of Iyase-Odozi's visual expressivity. Then
                there is the exhibition component, which showcases sizeable
                mixed media paintings. The third prospective enunciates art
                installation. Parenthetically, I note that it wasn't too long
                ago that the term, “art installation” provoked a quixotic pablum
                in certain art circles in Nigeria. But I digress. In the fourth
                visual engagement, the artist periscopes the art of batik and
                dives full-strength into the visualization of a bejeweled,
                dazzling articulation of designs recuperated, refurbished,
                re-contextualized, re-imagined, or simply repurposed from the
                stock of familiar visual motifs and iconography. Finally, an art
                workshop will summit this massive endeavor, which is projected
                to occur in multiple sites across Nigeria. Phew!<br />Without
                doubt, Iyase-Odozi's latest calibration gestures towards the
                past even as it foregrounds the future. She is focused on
                excavating the formidable but latent heritage of her ancestors
                to advance a contemporary chapter in visuality, one that
                inspires the artist to optimize her critical and creative
                capital and think beyond the narrow scope of art as, well, just
                art. In this outing, Iyase-Odozi expands the limits of her
                creative mission by supplementing her visual repertoire with
                appropriation. And where else would such appropriation come from
                but her revered Benin ancestry, with its storied legacy? It is a
                legacy that palpitates in world-class museums today but, at
                home, continues to fuel the imagination of an emerging crop of
                young scholar-artists. Here, Peju Layiwola's earlier project on
                Benin springs to mind. Iyase-Odozi's current engagement aims at
                paying homage to Iyase N'Udo of Udo, the father who planted the
                seed of creative occupancy in an enthusiastic daughter. Now, you
                know the rest of the story, as that inimitable American radio
                personality, Paul Harvey, used to quip. <br />Ladi Kwali; Clara
                Ugbodaga-Ngu; Aﬁ Ekong; Colette Omogbai; Agbo Oshinowo; Nike
                Okundaye: these are some of the iconic personae in the pantheon
                of creative goddesses in Nigerian art. As Theresa IyaseOdozi
                attempts to supplement the growing population of active artists,
                especially our women artists, as she strives to complement the
                nascent expropriation of natal iconography, she is richly
                deserving of the support of all - the public, the media,
                academic institutions but most especially corporate
                establishments who could use their support for art to boost
                their corporate citizenship.
