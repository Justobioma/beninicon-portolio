                Princess Iyase-Odozi's research into the historic methods and
                materials of Edo batikmaking provides the viewer ﬁrst-hand
                contact with this unique textile popularly adorned by the Edo
                people just a few decades ago. Viewed in a collection, these
                fabrics give an insight into how members of a royal household in
                the Benin kingdom adorned themselves. Although the dye colours
                mostly used were earthy browns, she has extended this a notch
                further by rendering the batik in predominantly reds and
                magenta. It is well known that the sources for dye in ancient
                Benin was from tree barks, Kola nuts and oxide-coloured soft
                stone which the people processed by grinding, pounding and
                fermenting. Some women also used these dyes in a mixture with
                clay to polish earthen ﬂoors and walls. It was the source of
                pigment before the arrival of the Europeans. According to Chief
                Okundaye (husband to Chief Mrs Nike Okundaye ),dye pigments were
                sourced from those 3 materials before the Europeans came. I
                interviewed him since he has a ﬁrst- hand experience (from his
                mother who was into this cra). As a young boy he watched as his
                own mother processed them by pounding, grinding and fermenting
                (his mother was a known practitioner of this craft in Benin).
                With the advent of new imported dyes the local practitioners
                quickly abandoned the hard-to-process indigenous dyes for the
                quick –to-use foreign dyes. Along with the introduction of
                foreign dyes came a wider range of colours. This action of
                theirs gradually led to the dearth of this unique fabric. With
                this new initiative, Edo batik is set to make a comeback.
                Princess IyaseOdozi has succeeded in restoring back to the
                people of Benin – and, by extension, Nigeria - a lost heritage,
                another indigenous textile they can be proud to export. On these
                fabrics, one ﬁnds a plethora of motifs, some used as raw images,
                others more stylised, including crosses indicative of early
                contact with Christian missionaries.

                  When there is any gathering anywhere in the universe to
                  discuss the Benin kingdom, it is mandatory to recognize the
                  presence, sacredness and authority of his Royal Majesty, Oba
                  Ewuare II the Oba of The Benin ancient kingdom was a peaceful
                  settlement situated in the midwest region of western Nigeria.
                  The kingdom spanned across the borders of river Niger in the
                  East, Idah in the North, with Lagos as a colony on the
                  Atlantic coast of southwest and the mangrove forests of
                  South-South at the coastal banks of Atlantic oceans. The
                  administration of Benin kingdom was such a peacefully
                  structured system of professional guilds in quarters-
                  Idumuewena, Igbesanmwan, Ivbiebo, (Guild of bronze caster,
                  Builders, Fashion Designers, Farmers etc) The communal Edo
                  Cultural traditions and way of life astonished the European
                  visitors on ﬁrst arrival to Benin. The organizational and
                  administrative structure of the kingdom was a discomfort to
                  the western invaders. The Holy Aruosa was replaced with
                  Christianity. However, the replacement of Aruosa with
                  Christianity did not lead to transformation. Nothing has come
                  out of it so far, than a people divided on what Osanobua god
                  is. The more spiritual experiences people have, the more
                  religious arguments and diversities. Benin Iconography is the
                  way people of Benin Kingdom present ideas in pictures, images,
                  religion, politics, language, food, music, dance and general
                  living. Ferdinard De Saussure a Swiss father of semantics has
                  the following to say:<br />
                  <i
                    >“Semiotics is about how sign produce meaning through
                    analysis. Such analysis is a social fuction not
                    individual”</i
                  ><br />
                  It's a shared norm-agreed on, in a particular communal
                  setting. For example, that is why popular culture drives
                  semiotics. This is domiciled in visual literacy – visual
                  communication of signs and symbols understood by all within a
                  particular

                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                  The preview of the Benin Iconography Exhibition took oﬀ on a
                  very positive note at the Thought Pyramid Art Centre, Ikoyi.
                  The joint-event consisted of a Press Preview and an Art
                  Discourse and was well attended by some prominent Nigerian and
                  foreign Art Stakeholders. Princess Iyase-Odozi, a renowned
                  Nigerian female visual artist and a product of University of
                  Lagos where I lecture, made a power-point presentation to
                  provide the background to the Exhibition and highlight the
                  processes entailed in producing the works to be exhibited.
                  What she is oﬀering with such passion is a new and unique
                  vista of Benin contemporary modernist art practice which she
                  seeks to deploy in celebrating the laudable eﬀorts of Oba
                  Ewuare II of Benin to revitalise the culture. Iyase-Odozi's
                  professional reputation as a contemporary visual artist
                  precedes her through her works and she has now challenged Art
                  historians by her visual narrative on some dimensions of Benin
                  Art, particularly its iconography. Thus, during the recent
                  Press Preview event, I stressed the urgent need for proper
                  documentation of our Arts and Culture, which Iyase-Odozi is
                  doing in her own way by appropriating the icons she found on
                  ancient Benin artefacts for her mixed-media paintings.
                  Iyase-Odozi attaches great signiﬁcance and meaning to these
                  icons, particularly the Circled Cross, the latter of which she
                  asserts is the symbol of Divine Truth. Thus, Iyase-Odozi's
                  latest creative exploration transcends the physical to embrace
                  deeper concepts and paradigms. This is, indeed, a signiﬁcant
                  and historic initiative that deserves commendation and support
                  by art stakeholders, particularly the Benin royalty, the State
                  Government and promoters.
