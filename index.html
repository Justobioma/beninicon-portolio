              <p class="card-text">
                The Green House Art Gallery, established in 2009, is committed
                to promoting Nigerian Art and Artists by showcasing their works
                through solo and group exhibitions, among other key objectives.
                In pursuing this core objective, we have been closely involved
                in the professional activities and growth of Princess Theresa
                Oghogho IyaseOdozi. Her major solo exhibitions which we have
                promoted during the last decade include: Arrival (2009); On Thy
                Roots We Stand (2012); Ounje Ale Oluwa – The Last Supper of
                Jesus & His 12 Disciples – (2014); and Spiritual Contemplations
                ( 2015) . The works displayed during these exhibitions cover
                mundane, abstract and spiritual dimensions, with increasing
                accent on the last of these endeavours. In preparation for the
                current exhibition, Iyase-Odozi organised an art discourse with
                the theme “Renaissance of Imagery and Symbolism in Benin
                Iconography: Iyase-Odozi's Appropriations in Focus”, as a
                preview of the main event. An important dimension of the
                appropriation of ancient Benin icons for this exhibition, is the
                providential discovery of the Circled Cross, embossed on brass
                plaques and costumes, which were in use during the time of 16th
                century Oba Esigie. There are many meanings and interpretations
                surrounding the Circled Cross in various cultures, this symbol
                having predated Christianity by thousands of years. It has been
                variously called the Sun/Solar Cross, the Dyeus Cross and Zeus
                Cross, among other names. Given its extensive use as a
                representation of Divine Truth, it is not surprising that this
                symbol has found its way into Christian iconography. Thus, the
                spiritual essence and signiﬁcance of the re-emergence of the
                Circled Cross, this symbol of Divine Truth, in Benin City
                through this exhibition, should not be lost on us. No doubt,
                many questions will emerge about the origins, meanings and uses
                of the Circled Cross and other ancient icons evident in
                Iyase-Odozi's art, and how they could be eﬀectively integrated
                into contemporary, popular culture. These are questions calling
                for further research. But for now, we should recognise that the
                reemergence of the Circled Cross, this symbol of Divine Truth,
                during the reign of HRM OmoN'ObaN'Edo, Uku' Akpolokpolo Ewuare
                II, is a good omen for Benin Kingdom. It is, indeed, our hope
                that this exhibition would serve to create awareness of these
                rich but long-forgotten icons and set aglow a renaissance of
                Benin iconography.

                  Over the years, I have come to recognise and admire the wealth
                  of Benin culture. This appreciation has been reinforced by my
                  beloved father (Iyase N'Udo of Udo). I have thus developed the
                  yearning to promote enlightenment about that culture and the
                  history that sustains it, a quest that has propels my research
                  into Benin art history. Since then, I have been completely
                  absorbed in this endeavour. The outcomes both in terms of the
                  works I have produced so far and my personal experience have
                  been highly fulfilling. This journey has eventuated in this
                  art exhibition, which I plan to display in many museums
                  associated with Benin artefacts across the globe. Below is a
                  brief narrative on the desk research findings and the art
                  works produced for the exhibition. Research findings reveal
                  that the special Ewua officials, also called the 'Omada', who
                  belonged to one of the many guilds found in Benin played
                  significant roles during Oba Esigie's era (1504-1550) and had
                  cordial relationships with both the Portuguese and the
                  British. Prominently displayed on the costumes of members of
                  this guild were encircled crosses which were incorporated
                  within these costumes probably under the influence of Oba
                  Esigie as the Master of the Circled Cross. Blackmun notes that
                  “the Cross was important to Oba Esigie; although, its full
                  significance cannot be easily interpreted”. The works of art
                  produced for this exhibition amply demonstrate the intricacies
                  of the icons found on these artefacts that are more than four
                  hundred years old. I visualise Benin art works as going beyond
                  mere sculptural works to encompass the esoteric, adoring their
                  works of art as 'worship', since the royal court art is
                  identified with 'OSANOBUA, THE ALMIGHTY FATHER. The works I
                  have created under this inspiration emanated from my spirit
                  and, therefore, bear life within them, as stated in the Bible,
                  and reiterated in the Grail Message, from which I have drawn
                  immense inspiration. “By their works ye shall know them',
                  these works declare. Circumstances where 'Art remains Art'
                  throughout history affirm that the spiritual rules.” Overall,
                  I affirm that BeninIconograpy.Com, my brand name for this
                  initiative, will outlive humanity, reaching into the infinite.
                  As the Exhibiting Artist I am privileged to produce these
                  historical works which I plan to display in many museums
                  across the globe, thereby promoting contemporary Benin art. I
                  see this project as an auspicious moment, coming as it does,
                  in the early years of the reign of His Royal Majesty, Oba
                  Ewuare II, in acknowledgement of his unwavering commitment to
                  the revitalisation of Benin cultural heritage. Indeed, it is
                  in his honour that this Exhibition is being mounted in October
                  2019. Oba ghato, Okpere! Long live the King! The selection of
                  my art works being mounted at this Exhibition, conjoining
                  Benin history and culture through the lens of Benin royalty,
                  came fortuitously in the course of working on my Ph.D.
                  dissertation titled, “The Visual Arts in Empowering Women and
                  the Girl-Child in Nigeria: Nike Centre for Arts and Culture in
                  Focus”. In the process, I stumbled on the rich iconography
                  deployed on artefacts of over 500 years old. The uniqueness of
                  the icons I found so fascinated me that I couldn't resist the
                  temptation to appropriate them by transferring the intricate
                  icons onto fabrics tagged 'Edo Batik', thereby creating the
                  mixed media works visible at this Exhibition. It also dawned
                  on me that Edo Batik could be deployed as a vehicle for
                  empowerment, an idea that I believe would fascinate many
                  stakeholders and art scholars. Hence, the inclusion of a
                  workshop on the theme “Empowerment” as part of the Exhibition.
                  In appropriating and deploying these long-forgotten icons,
                  discovered by me on old sculptural artefacts produced by our
                  ancestors, transposing them into my Edo Batik initiative, my
                  appreciation of their iconographic resonance has continued to
                  expand. However, I have merely scratched the surface of a
                  profound subject. Thus, I hope my work galvanises further
                  research into the semiotic values of these motifs, further
                  unravelling their stylistic accomplishments, meanings and
                  historical and total cultural significance.
